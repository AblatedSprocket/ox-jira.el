* ox-jira-test.el --- tests for ox-jira.el

  This is my first foray into testing in Emacs. Please be patient.

** Conventional headers

*** Short description

    #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
      ;;; ox-jira-test.el --- tests for ox-jira.el
    #+END_SRC

*** Author

    #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
      ;;; Author: Stig Brautaset <stig@brautaset.org>
    #+END_SRC

*** Distribution

    #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
      ;; This file is NOT part of GNU Emacs.
    #+END_SRC

*** Copyright & License

    I prefer the MIT license because it is short enough to read without toilet
    or tea breaks, and I _think_ I can actually wrap my head around it. (And I
    feel it's important to understand the license of your choice.)

    #+END_SRC

*** Code

    Lastly a special header to denote that we're done with the header section
    and starting the actual code now.

    #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
      ;;; Code:
    #+END_SRC

** Code

*** Require libraries

   The first thing our code needs to do is require the libraries we need. This
   is cargo-culted from [[https://github.com/NicolasPetton/seq.el/blob/master/test/seq.el-test.el][seq.el-test.el]].

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (require 'ert)
     (require 'ox)
     (require 'ox-jira)
   #+END_SRC

*** Hello World

    Let's write the simplest possible test that actually invokes anything org
    export related.

    #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
      (ert-deftest ox-jira-test/hello-world ()
        (should (equal "hello world\n" (org-export-string-as "hello world" 'jira))))
    #+END_SRC

*** Provide

    Announce that =ox-jira-test= is a feature of the current Emacs.

    #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
      (provide 'ox-jira-test)
    #+END_SRC

** Footer

   All this does is help people figure out if a file has been truncated. If
   they see that comment, they know they don't have just half the file.

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     ;;; ox-jira.el-test.el ends here
   #+END_SRC
