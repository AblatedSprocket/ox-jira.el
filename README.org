#+TITLE: ox-jira.el --- JIRA Backend for Org Export Engine
#+AUTHOR: Stig Brautaset
* Introduction

  Export Org mode files to JIRA markup for pasting into JIRA tickets &
  comments.

  My last three jobs I've had to use JIRA, and had to deal with its (to me)
  incredibly unintuitive markup format. Having discovered---and fallen in
  love with---Org mode I now find myself writing everything in Org and
  exporting to various other formats (html, markdown, plain text) but I
  haven't been able to find a way to export to JIRA. So I am attempting to
  write one, and learn about Emacs package development at the same time.

* Maturity

  Very immature. Positively juvenile. Please don't laugh.
