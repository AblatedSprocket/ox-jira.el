* ox-jira - an Org export backend for JIRA

  Export Org mode files to JIRA markup for pasting into JIRA tickets &
  comments.

** Motivation

   My last three jobs I've had to use JIRA, and had to deal with its (to me)
   incredibly unintuitive markup format. Having discovered---and fallen in
   love with---Org mode I now find myself writing everything in Org and
   exporting to various other formats (html, markdown, plain text) but I
   haven't been able to find a way to export to JIRA. So I am attempting to
   write one, and learn about Emacs package development at the same time.

** Maturity

   Very immature. Positively juvenile. Please don't laugh.

** License

   Let's say MIT, shall we? Can I? I'm not even sure.
